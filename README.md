# Phonenow_Call_Center
•  In this project, I Developed a dashboard in Power BI and utilized DAX functions for advanced calculations to monitor and analyze long-term trends in customer and agent behavior at the PhoneNow call center. PWC conducted a Virtual Experience Program on theforage.com website and the dataset consist of 4055 records.

#### From the analysis, I found answers to interesting questions such as:
##### 1.How many customers answered the call, and how many did not answer the call?
2. How many customers had their problems resolved, and how many did not?
3. What is the overall customer satisfaction?
4. What is the average speed of answering the call?
5. What is the overview of the performance of each agent?

• The dataset consists of details like Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Answered, Resolved, Speed of answer in seconds, AvgTalkDuration and Satisfaction rating.
